### Future possible enhancements
- terraform state search and delete

- ~~cli auto installation scripts~~ -> done
- more error checks in api or cli
- web ui
- pipeline for gitlab

>WARNING: Even if backend stands on python-gitlab(It's able to run in different gitlab versions) I must point out this tool is only tested for GitLab 14.3.x
